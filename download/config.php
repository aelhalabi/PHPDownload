PHP Download	- Version: 1.0

Installation:

	1. Upload the script to a folder that you named   /download/ 
		you can change it but you need to change a couple of lines in the script.

	2. The script is configured to send one single file preferably as a zipped .zip (that saves bandwidth also)

	3. Upload the file you're sending to  the folder /download/files/ (we included EZDownload.zip as an example)

	4. Change the settings above to your site

	5. Enjoy!
